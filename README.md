Code which i have provided is currently incomple like signup module and all other stuff

i created to do app for fun, just i tried to learn how context is different from redux below is main diff

Context

   -conetxt is by default package which is provided by react itself, we no need to install package from third party library.

   -Biggest Drowback of context : context use react state object means it not save data any local storage and session storage, it effect when we reload page then our entired data which we have stored in context it will gone.

Redux

    -benefits of using redux is, it is store data in local storage means when we reload page then our data is still there, 
     no need to call api again and again, that is one biggest reason we use redux in production.


explore whole code and try to make whole app functional, please create new pr i'll review code and then merged in my code.
try yo contribute in this open source project as much as posible.


thank for your valuable time.
